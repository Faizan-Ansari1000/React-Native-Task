# Project Overview
This is a modern and clean React Native mobile app that showcases a list of products fetched from an API. Users can view product images, titles, and prices in a beautifully styled card layout. The app includes search functionality, allowing users to filter products by title, and also features smooth navigation between screens.

It also includes a camera screen where users can capture an image using their phone's camera and view the captured image immediately. The app is designed with a focus on simplicity, performance, and user-friendly UI using React Native CLI.

# Tech Stack

React Native for building the mobile app.
React Navigation for screen navigation.
Axios for API requests.
React Native Image Picker for capturing images.
Fakestore API for product data.

# Getting Started

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android
